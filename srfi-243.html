  <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>
  <h3 id="what-is-unreadable-data">What is unreadable data?</h3>
  <p>Lisp code is represented as data. A Lisp system can be asked
  to write any live object as an S-expression. However, it’s
  inevitable that some of those objects have complex environmental
  dependencies which are difficult or impossible to write down.</p>
  <p>The prototypical example of such an object is a port. Other
  common examples are procedures, continuations, promises,
  parameters, environments, and libraries. Objects managed by a
  foreign function interface tend to be unreadable. Additionally,
  objects that stand in for end-of-file and unspecified values are
  commonly written as unreadable objects since it makes little
  sense to read them.</p>
  <h3 id="existing-syntax">Existing syntax</h3>
  <p>Common Lisp reserves the lexical syntax
  <code>#&lt;...&gt;</code> for unreadable data.</p>
  <p>Apart from being <em>de jure</em> standard in Common Lisp,
  this syntax is <em>de facto</em> standard in Scheme.</p>
  <p>For example, Chicken writes a port as <code>#&lt;output port
  "(stdout)"&gt;</code>.</p>
  <p>MIT Scheme and STklos use square brackets <code>#[...]</code>
  instead of angle brackets.</p>
  <p>For example, MIT Scheme writes a port as
  <code>#[textual-i/o-port 12 for console]</code>.</p>
  <h3 id="data-versus-objects">Data versus objects</h3>
  <p>The syntaxes <code>#&lt;...&gt;</code> and <code>#[...]</code>
  look as if the brackets are intended to delimit an S-expression
  like parentheses delimit lists. But the delimiters tend to be
  illusory.</p>
  <p>Angle brackets are not delimiters in any Scheme implementation
  nor in Common Lisp. They are identifier characters used in the
  names of well-known procedures such as <code>&lt;</code> and
  <code>string&gt;=</code>.</p>
  <p>Scheme implementations accepting square brackets as list
  delimiters are common but far from universal, and these
  implementations tend to use <code>#&lt;...&gt;</code> syntax for
  unreadable data. STklos is the only known implementation which
  both accepts <code>[...]</code> lists and uses
  <code>#[...]</code> for unreadable data.</p>
  <p>The use of identifier characters like <code>&lt;</code>
  <code>&gt;</code> as delimiters implies the writer will not
  output a well-formed S-expression. The standard Scheme
  <code>write</code> procedure is meant to output an internally
  consistent structure whereas <code>display</code> may take more
  liberties. The use of ill-formed syntax to write unreadable
  objects suits the spirit of <code>display</code> but not the
  spirit of <code>write</code>.</p>
  <p>When one or more unreadable objects are nested in an otherwise
  readable structure, and are written using ill-formed syntax, the
  reader cannot recover any part of the structure. Nor can it
  recover subsequent structures from the same port. This will cause
  difficulties when S-expressions become more pervasive. As people
  work with larger and more heterogeneous expressions in a wider
  variety of contexts, it will be inconvenient to ensure that all
  written expressions consist only of readable objects.</p>
  <h3 id="unreadable-objects">Unreadable objects</h3>
  <p>In this SRFI we talk about <em>unreadable data</em> in general
  and <em>unreadable objects</em> in particular.</p>
  <p>An <em>unreadable object</em> is any object written as a
  well-formed S-expression such that the reader cannot recover the
  original object, but can recover a <em>stand-in object</em>
  representing the original.</p>
  <p>For example, assume an implementation which can parse the
  lexical syntax <code>#[primitive append]</code> and extract a
  list of two symbols, <code>primitive</code> and
  <code>append</code>. The syntax represents an unreadable object
  (presumably the standard procedure <code>append</code>) and the
  list is the stand-in for the original object.</p>
  <p>Since the syntax is well-formed, the reader can keep reading
  past the unreadable object to recover more objects (if there are
  any). The reader can also handle structures containing any mix of
  readable and unreadable objects nested to an arbitrary depth. For
  example, the following structure is lightly adapted from Chez
  Scheme.</p>
  <pre>
#[transcoded-port utf8-codec #[buffered-port #[binary-output-port stdout]]]</pre>
  <p>To differentiate between readable and unreadable objects in
  nested structures, this SRFI introduces a special data type for
  unreadable objects. (The data type simply encapsulates the
  stand-in object.)</p>
  <h3 id="unreadable-data">Unreadable data</h3>
  <p>The syntax <code>#&lt;...&gt;</code> is deeply entrenched in
  Lisp and Scheme culture and cannot be rooted out in any
  reasonable amount of time. This SRFI tries to broker peace by not
  dictating any particular syntax. Implementations are free to keep
  using traditional syntax.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately the <code>#&lt;...&gt;</code> syntax does not
  meet the requirements given above for <em>unreadable
  objects</em>. For example, the Common Lisp specification
  says:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><code>#&lt;</code> is not valid reader syntax. The Lisp
    reader will signal an error of type <code>reader-error</code>
    on encountering <code>#&lt;</code>. This syntax is typically
    used in the printed representation of objects that cannot be
    read back in.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Scheme implementations behave similarly: The reader simply
  discards all text following the marker <code>#&lt;</code>.</p>
  <p>We accommodate syntaxes of this kind by providing the minimal
  guarantee that the implementation stops reading after
  encountering the unreadable data marker and raises an exception.
  The exception handler may read the rest of the data from the port
  as unstructured text if the programmer so chooses.</p>
  <h3 id="future-ports">Future ports</h3>
  <p>Current editions of RnRS say that <code>read</code> and
  <code>write</code> use textual ports. There is no fundamental
  reason for this restriction. Binary S-expressions have been
  demonstrated to work well, and could be accessed via the same
  programming interface as textual S-expressions. In fact, even
  non-S-expression formats such as JSON and ASN.1 could share the
  same interface.</p>
  <p>Consequently the specification in this SRFI avoids talking
  about text. Instead it talks about <em>data</em> which can be
  either text or bytes.</p>
  <p>It makes sense for a large Scheme implementation to support
  more than one variant of S-expression syntax or even to have a
  programmable reader and writer. There is no existing standard,
  but there is a consensus that the best approach is to attach a
  lexical syntax to each port object. This way different ports can
  use different syntax without getting mixed up.</p>
  <p>This SRFI addresses the situation by requiring
  <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> to mind which port they
  are dealing with, and to use the appropriate syntax (if any) for
  unreadable data on that port.</p>
  <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>
  <h3 id="stand-in-objects">Stand-in objects</h3>
  <p><code>(unreadable-object? object) =&gt; boolean</code></p>
  <p>Return <code>#t</code> if <em>object</em> stands in for an
  unreadable object. Else return <code>#f</code>.</p>
  <p><code>(unreadable-object stand-in) =&gt;
  unreadable-object</code></p>
  <p>Make an unreadable object using the given <em>stand-in</em>,
  which can be any object.</p>
  <p><code>(unreadable-object-stand-in unreadable-object) =&gt;
  stand-in</code></p>
  <p>Return the stand-in of <em>unreadable-object</em>.</p>
  <h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
  <p><code>(read [port]) =&gt; object</code></p>
  <p>This RnRS procedure is expanded to account for unreadable
  data. (Similar modifications should be made to other procedures
  that read objects from ports.)</p>
  <p>When encountering a top-level object that contains one or more
  unreadable objects, or is itself an unreadable object, a
  <code>unreadable-error</code> is raised and the
  <code>unreadable-error-object</code> is the offending top-level
  object. The top-level object has been encoded such that each
  unreadable object in it (including the top-level object itself,
  if it is unreadable) is wrapped in the
  <code>unreadable-object</code> data type. The port position lies
  directly after the top-level object. It is unspecified whether
  atmosphere (whitespace and comments) following the top-level
  object have been consumed. The programmer may attempt to read
  more objects from the port.</p>
  <p>When encountering unreadable data that is not an unreadable
  object, an <code>unreadable-error</code> is raised and the
  <code>unreadable-error-object</code> is <code>#f</code>. The port
  position lies immediately after the marker which indicates the
  start of unreadable data. For example, in the case of a textual
  port for which the unreadable data marker is <code>#&lt;</code>
  the next <code>read-char</code> will read the character
  immediately following the <code>&lt;</code>. In general, it does
  not make sense to attempt to read objects from the port at this
  point.</p>
  <p><code>(unreadable-error? object) =&gt; boolean</code></p>
  <p>Return <code>#t</code> if <em>object</em> is an unreadable
  data error. Else return <code>#f</code>.</p>
  <p>All unreadable data errors also satisfy the RnRS
  <code>read-error?</code> predicate. In other words, unreadable
  data errors are a subtype of read errors.</p>
  <p><code>(unreadable-error-object error) =&gt; object</code></p>
  <p>If all unreadable data were encoded as stand-in objects which
  the implementation was able to read, return the top-level object
  containing those unreadable objects. The top-level object may or
  may not itself be an unreadable object.</p>
  <p>If the unreadable data was not encoded as a stand-in, the
  return value is <code>#f</code>.</p>
  <h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>
  <p><code>(write object [port])</code></p>
  <p>This RnRS procedure is expanded to account for unreadable
  data. (Similar modifications should be made to
  <code>display</code>, <code>write-shared</code>,
  <code>write-simple</code>, and other procedures that write
  objects to ports.)</p>
  <p>If <em>object</em> satisfies <code>unreadable-object?</code>
  or is some other type of unreadable object for which a stand-in
  can be generated, then the stand-in is written to <em>port</em>
  using an implementation-defined lexical syntax. The syntax may
  vary based on implementation-defined settings attached to
  <em>port</em>.</p>
  <p>For example, the stand-in <code>(procedure append)</code> — a
  list of the two symbols <code>procedure</code> and
  <code>append</code> — could represent a procedure and could be
  written using the syntax <code>#[procedure append]</code>.</p>
  <p>If <em>object</em> cannot be written to <em>port</em> for
  syntax reasons then an exception satisfying
  <code>unwritable-error?</code> is raised.</p>
  <p><code>(unwritable-error? object) =&gt; boolean</code></p>
  <p>Return <code>#t</code> if <em>object</em> is an unwritable
  object error. Else return <code>#f</code>.</p>
  <p>Possible causes for the error include the following.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The port's syntax cannot encode any unreadable data at
    all.</li>
    <li>The implementation does not know how to encode a stand-in
    for this particular object.</li>
    <li>The programmer has set an implementation-defined flag
    saying that trying to write unreadable data to the port should
    raise an error.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><code>(unwritable-error-object error) =&gt; object</code></p>
  <p>Returns the original object for which no stand-in could be
  written.</p>
  <p>If one or more unwritable objects are nested within an
  otherwise writable object, it is unspecified whether the object
  returned by <code>unwritable-error-object</code> is the top-level
  object or one of the nested unwritable objects.</p>
  <h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
  <p>In implementations with an R6RS-style condition system, it is
  recommended that the condition types <code>&amp;unreadable</code>
  and <code>&amp;unwritable</code> be defined.</p>
  <p>The implementation should write well-formed unreadable objects
  instead of ill-formed unreadable data whenever feasible.</p>
  <p>The unreadable object syntax should closely resemble the
  syntax for ordinary lists, for example by using parentheses or
  square brackets with a suitable prefix.</p>
  <p>The stand-in should be a list.</p>
  <p>The first element of the list should be a symbol. Known
  symbols are tracked in the <a href=
  "https://registry.scheme.org/">Scheme Registry</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
  <p>Assume an implementation that reads and writes unreadable
  objects using the lexical syntax <code>#[...]</code> such that
  the <code>[...]</code> part represents a list.</p>
  <p>Then the following code snippet:</p>
  <pre>(guard (err
        (unreadable-error?
         (let* ((top (unreadable-error-object err))
                (outer (unreadable-object-stand-in (list-ref top 5)))
                (inner (unreadable-object-stand-in (list-ref outer 2))))
           (define (wr msg obj) (display msg) (write obj) (newline))
           (wr "inner stand-in: " inner)
           (wr "outer stand-in: " outer)
           (wr "top object: " top))))

       (read-from-string "(here is an unreadable object #[1 2 #[3 4 5]])"))</pre>
  <p>will display the following output:</p>
  <pre>inner stand-in: (3 4 5)
outer stand-in: (1 2 #[3 4 5])
top object: (here is an unreadable object #[1 2 #[3 4 5]])
</pre>
  <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
  <p>Two sample implementations are provided.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>One written in Scheme as a patch to Göran Weinholt's
    "laesare" library.</li>
    <li>One written in C as a patch to the STklos Scheme
    implementation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In general, the following implementation strategy is
  recommended.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When reading nested data, keep a flag to remember whether
    any unreadable objects have been encountered.</li>
    <li>Every such object is wrapped in the
    <code>unreadable-object</code> data type and the wrapped object
    is stored in the structure being built. Keep in mind that
    unreadable objects can be nested.</li>
    <li>When the top-level read procedure has built a complete
    object, it checks the unreadable object flag. If the flag is
    set, it raises an <code>unreadable-error</code> exception whose
    <code>unreadable-error-object</code> is the offending top-level
    object. If the flag is not set, it returns the object as
    usual.</li>
    <li>If the reader encounters unreadable data that isn't an
    unreadable object, it immediately raises an
    <code>unreadable-error</code> exception whose
    <code>unreadable-error-object</code> is <code>#f</code> without
    trying to read anything more.</li>
  </ul>
